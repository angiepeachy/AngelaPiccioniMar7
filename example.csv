 rainbow rider ," 58mm, 82A, "," wider fit, minimal padding", adjustable (metric thread),"The Rainbow Rider is great at its affordable price of $109 for someone just getting into skating, and it comes in three fun rainbow-styled colorways.  With a change of wheels, you can dance skate too!  It has a lot of ankle flexibility for a wide range of moves.  Also, this skate tends to run wide so it’s ideal for wider feet."
 beach bunny ," 58mm, 78A, "," narrow fit, well padded", adjustable powerdyne,"The Beach Bunny is the next best skate for affordability at $169.  It comes in five colors and has great ankle support that keeps you feeling safe! You can dance skate in them with a change of wheels.  While we don’t recommend it, you can even do some light park skating in them.  Evelyn Ivyy started her skate journey in them since they’re vegan friendly!"
 panther roller skate ," 58mm, 78A, "," narrow fit, well padded", adjustable powerdyne,"The Panther roller skate is similar to the Lolly in that it uses suede as the main material of the boot, except it comes only in black with a leopard liner and has a PVC unit around the ankle for more support.  This skate would be a better option for people that want more stability and support when trying to land tricks that might be heavier on the ankles, and it’s not quite as expensive as the Jack boot so if you’re just getting into park skating, this is a good option to dip your toes in."
 lolly ," 65mm, 78A, "," avg fit, no padding, molds to foot", adjustable powerdyne,The Lolly roller skates feature high-quality suede that requires almost no break in time! The suede material of the boot gives the most comfortable cruise in an array of all the colors of the rainbow and black!  There’s lots of ankle flexibility and a good plate to start some light park skating with a change of wheels. We sell them as “completes” or as boot-only if you want to attach your own hardware to them.
 jack 1 ,,,,"The Jack boot is a great starter for more aggressive skating or dance skating with more ankle support.  We sell these as boot-only or as custom packages like the Estro Package, so you can build the ultimate skate set-up of your dreams!  After around 10 hours of break in time, the suede skate comfortably molds around your feet.  The Jack's come in all the same rainbow colors as the Lolly as well as a white vegan leather."
 jack 2 ,,,,"The Jack 2 boot is the ultimate skate for aggressive skating because it has more support than the first Jack.  Also with the Jack 2 builds, you can order any of the standard colors (Lilac, True Blue, Black, White Vegan) or even special colors like Poppy and Taffy!  Because it features additional support, the Jack 2 needs about 20 hours of break in time. After that the suede skate molds around your feet to give you the stiffest and most secure skate to land hard-impact tricks."
